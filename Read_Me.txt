This is a mini-project I built in Python during the course of a few hours at a beginner hackathon. Fibbage is an Xbox One trivia game where players are asked a question and then submit fake answers in an attempt to trick other players. The goal is to get the correct answer out of the pool of lies. This is a simple clone of that game. 

Questions.py is where game questions are stored. Players are encouraged to add their own into the file as there are very few starter questions.

Run Fibbage_Hot_Seat.py to play.
